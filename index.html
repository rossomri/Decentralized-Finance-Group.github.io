							<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
							<p><font color="white">
                                The Decentralized Finance Group is a joint research center located at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen led by Dr. Omri Ross. The group promotes applied multidisciplinary research addressing computational challenges in the financial industries. We are involved in a range of academic and commercial projects and accepts applications from highly qualified PhD candidates and Post Doc’s on an ongoing basis.<br /></font>

									<h3>Digital Asset Infrastructure</h3>
									<p>We address the application of digital asset infrastructure, with emphasis on computational problems in the post-trade cycle.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
									<h3>Compliance Optimization</h3>
									<p>Compliance, reporting and transparency are defining properties of the decade ahead. Our research addresses transaction reporting and data sharing issues with emphasis on mitigating risks and reducing costs in key business processes. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Domain Specific Programming Languages</h3>
									<p> We design and implement declarative and formally verified domain specific languages for financial contracts with emphasis on improving security and mitigating execution risks in the evaluation of financial contracts on distributed ledger technology, or permissionless blockchains. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Decentralized Governance</h3>
									<p>The future of finance will be built on permissionless decentralized computational infrastructure. Thus far, the majority of these systems are maintained by open-source communities and non-profit entities. As such, the governance mechanisms, social norms or implied regulation controlling these processes presents multiple urgent issues of both economic and behavioural relevance.</p>
